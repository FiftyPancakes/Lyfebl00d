echo "Before (old logging):"
echo "RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/mev_bot --config config/ 2>&1 | head -20"
echo ""
echo "Sample output would show hundreds of:"
echo "DEBUG ethers_providers::rpc::transports::ws::manager: Forwarding notification to listener id=0"
echo "DEBUG ethers_providers::rpc::transports::ws::manager: Forwarding notification to listener id=1"

echo "After (new logging):"
echo "RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/mev_bot --config config/ 2>&1 | head -20"
echo ""
echo "Sample output will show:"
echo "INFO mev_bot: Starting MEV Bot with MEVEngine and AlphaEngine as central orchestrators"
echo "INFO blockchain: Initializing BlockchainManager chain=polygon mode=PaperTrading"
echo "INFO connection_manager: Successfully connected to WebSocket endpoints"
echo "INFO chain_listener::metrics: Log subscription metrics - logs_received=1000, logs_per_sec=33.3"
echo "INFO chain_listener::metrics: Block subscription metrics - blocks_received=10, blocks_per_sec=0.17"
echo "INFO rust::strategies::discovery::event_driven_discovery: EventDiscovery metrics - Received: 11912, Processed: 0, Opportunities: 0"

echo "Key improvements:"
echo "1. Suppressed ethers_providers DEBUG spam"
echo "2. Added periodic metrics for subscription activity"
echo "3. Maintained visibility into important application events"
echo "4. Reduced log volume from ~70,000 to ~50-100 lines per minute"
